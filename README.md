## PROBLEM STATEMENT

If your pet is missing, you will look for it. You will try many options, such as asking your neighbors, waiting until they come back home, osting notices of nearby places, or searching everywhere. se options are not good or efficient. We need an efficient solution for this matter.

## SOLUTION
##### ***SMART PET COLLAR***
<img width="461" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cepdnaclk/e18-3yp-smart-pet-collar/main/docs/assets/img/architecture/system_zoom.png">

We proposed a solution that is a smart pet belt. It is a wearable and waterproof device. herefore, you need to wear it on your pet and connect it to your PC or mobile phone. Simply put, you can easily obtain corresponding details.

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW
##### ***HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW***

<img width="461" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cepdnaclk/e18-3yp-smart-pet-collar/main/docs/assets/img/architecture/high_level_system.png">

This is the high-level architecture diagram of our system. Inside this device, we have a microcontroller and several sensors and other modules. Since this is a wearable device for pets, we can’t use a direct power supply. So we use a rechargeable battery, so the user can charge it once every few days. One of the main features of this system is tracking the pet’s location. For that, we use a GPS module, which can get location data through GPS satellites. For monitoring health, we get body temperature data and pulse data using a temperature sensor and a pulse sensor. We get the data related to orientation and movement using a gyroscope sensor. We use that data for the sleep monitoring feature. We also include a speaker with this device, so it can be used to implement a sound-based pet training feature. Finally, this has a GSM/GPRS module, to connect to the internet. So the device can send the data taken from the sensor to the cloud server.

What if the device lost network connectivity at some point? To address that issue, we wanted temporary storage. So the device can store the data temporarily and send it to the server when the network is restored. On the right side of the figure, we have the user and the application UI. Frontend. It can communicate with the backend and the database through the API. To connect the device with the backend cloud server, we will be using a MQTT broker. So we can set up a subscription for the device and share the sensor data and control signals through the MQTT protocol. We don’t pass real-time data to the server in regular mode. Every sensor's data will have a certain delay between two consecutive measurements. For example, the location data will only be sent once every 15 minutes.

- REACT: It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.
- Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.


## HARDWARE DESIGN

<img width="461" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cepdnaclk/e18-3yp-smart-pet-collar/main/docs/assets/img/3d_module/3d_design.jpeg">

This is the 3D design of the smart pet collar. The collar should not be too heavy on the pet's neck. As a result, we designed it in this manner. Here, you can see the rechargable battery on the top of the collar. And also, the main circuit board and speaker are also on the top of the collar. You can see two sensors inside the collar, which are a temperature sensor and a pulse sensor. The gyroscope sensor is on the main circuit board. Our product features are,

- Track your pet
- Analyze your pet’s sleep
- Measure the temperature
- Pulse of your pet
- Track the pet’s vaccination time

### MAIN CIRCUIT DIAGRAM

<img width="461" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cepdnaclk/e18-3yp-smart-pet-collar/main/docs/assets/img/hardware/circuit.png">

This is the circuit we used for our project. The circuit includes an Atmega328P in the middle. Other electronic and electrical components are as follows: 
- 10 uf capacitor
- 22 pf capacitors
- LED
- 10k resistor
- 16 MHz crystal oscillator

Then, all the other sensors and modulators are connected to this circuit. The circuit is powered by a rechargeable battery.
